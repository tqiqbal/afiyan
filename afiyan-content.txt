Streamlined ForgeRock Authentication for React Native and Flutter Apps

Opportunity
Integrating ForgeRock’s powerful identity and access management capabilities into React
Native and Flutter applications requires careful handling of authentication and
authorization workflows. While ForgeRock offers robust SDKs for native iOS and Android
platforms, developers building cross-platform apps with React Native or Flutter often need
tailored solutions to seamlessly manage authentication journeys, OAuth 2.0 tokens, and
user authorization across both iOS and Android.

Solution
At Afiyan, we’ve developed a custom SDK for React Native and Flutter that simplifies the
integration of ForgeRock Advanced Identity Cloud for authentication and authorization. Our
SDK abstracts the complexities of managing ForgeRock’s authentication journeys,
including its diverse callback types, into an intuitive, developer-friendly interface. Designed
to support both iOS and Android from a single codebase, our solution enables frontend
developers to efficiently implement secure login, token management, and user
authorization without deep expertise in ForgeRock’s native SDKs.

Our dedicated team of mobile app developers, with proven expertise in ForgeRock
integrations, works closely with your frontend team to provide hands-on guidance, ensuring
a smooth and efficient development process. Whether you’re building a new app or
enhancing an existing one, our custom SDK accelerates time-to-market while maintaining
security and scalability.


Key Features of Our Custom SDK
• Unified Authentication: Simplifies login flows with support for ForgeRock’s
authentication journeys, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) like SMS,
email, push, and biometrics.
• Seamless Authorization: Manages OAuth 2.0 and OIDC tokens for secure access
to protected resources across iOS and Android.
• Cross-Platform Efficiency: Built for React Native and Flutter, enabling a single
codebase for both platforms, reducing development time and effort.
• Robust Token Management: Handles token storage, refresh, and revocation,
addressing common issues like session persistence across app restarts.
• Developer-Friendly: Provides clear APIs and documentation, empowering frontend
developers to integrate ForgeRock with minimal learning curve.
